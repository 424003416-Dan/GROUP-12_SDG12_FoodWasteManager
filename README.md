# Food Waste Management System
## UN SDG 12: Responsible Consumption and Production

### Project Description
This is a C++ console application that helps track food inventory and reduce waste. The system implements three core Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA):

1. ARRAY (Prelim DSA): Used for storing and managing food inventory with fixed size arrays
2. STACK (Midterm DSA): Used for alert notifications using LIFO principle
3. MERGE SORT (Finals DSA): Used for sorting waste logs by quantity for analytics

### Installation and Setup
#### Prerequisites
- Code::Blocks IDE (or any C++ compiler like g++)
- Git for cloning

#### Steps to Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/424003416/GROUP-12_SDG12_FoodWasteManager.git

   cd GROUP-12_SDG12_FoodWasteManager
